# One-More-Brick-Bot
Simple Bot for the Game "One More Brick" written in Python using PyAutoGUI.
At the moment the bot doesn't make evaluated decision and is only used to farm stars.

## Setup
1. Download Google Play Beta on your PC and install One More Brick.
2. Install PyAutoGUI if you don't have it yet
3. Open One More Brick and start a game
4. Start the bot
5. Resize the window until the bot is happy
6. Now the bot will start playing

I highly recommend to spend two bucks to remove the ads or else the bot might click on some of them :).
